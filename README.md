This is the repository for my professional developer portfolio. On this website will be an introduction of me, Johnny Karam, as a person, and an introduction to my work.

## Why Build A Portfolio ?

All good developers who want to be recognized for job positions tend to have a decent looking portfolio so I tried to create one for myself. I hope it pays off in the end.

## The Technologies Behind My Portfolio

My portfolio uses Next.js as a react framework, with tailwind css styling, and sanity.io as a backend to store some information.
